					<h1>About This Endeavor</h1>
					<h2>What is time banking?</h2>
					<h3>Itâ€™s a different way of valuing labor by using time as the currency.</h3>
					<h2>How does it work?</h2>
					<h3>People spend and earn time credits by sharing skills and helping others. If I take you up on an offer, 
					(such as you help me with CSS for 2 hours) you can bank those hours and use them later to have someone 
					else help you with something that you're looking for (like someone to teach you to make bagels)</h3>
					<h2>Can you go into debt? </h2>
					<h3>Yes. Receiving is just as important as giving. Do not be afraid of debt.</h3>
					<h2>Why are we doing it in this community?</h2>
